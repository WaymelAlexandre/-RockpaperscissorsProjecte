This week your task will be to build the UI for our end of semester project. Currently, the fundamental requirements of this UI have been mocked up here:
https://www.figma.com/file/n5UFYWrf6rkdDQ0NLctLUd/RPS-Swinburne-Style?node-id=0%3A1 (Links to an external site.)


The client only wishes for Release 1 to be developed -
do not do any more work then what they are asking for at this stage.
Your developed User Interface must implement routing to the two designed pages within Release 1,
how you communicate between these two pages is up to you.



What is required from you

This current iteration (of 3 to come) is asking for a Rock Paper, Scissors game
that allows the User to select an option in the first screen, then POST that option to a server,
and finally displays the result (win or loose and what was chosen)
back to the User on a new Route on the second screen.

You are required to create a new GitHub Repository and submit the link to this assignment page as soon as possible.
This repository can be public or private (add LachlanVelden-swin if its private).
